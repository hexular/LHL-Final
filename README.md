## 🔎 Overview

Jobify is a an app designed to allow users to request jobs from 'jobbers' in their area. From simple cleaning to farm work to construction, users can create a job posting with a description, hourly rate and estimated time for completion. 

Jobbers can view all the jobs available and accept the job of their choosing, either from a list or a map view which dynamically plots the jobs on a map around their current location.
